Marketing is a critical aspect of any product's journey from development to success. While traditional advertising can 
be costly, leveraging online platforms can be a cost-effective way to build brand awareness. Platforms such as Facebook, 
Instagram, Twitter, and LinkedIn provide ample opportunities to engage with audiences through content calendars, 
regular posts, and interactions with followers. But social media isn't just for promotion; it's a way to community 
around our product. That's why understanding your audience is a valuable part of your marketing strategy (customer 
segmentation marketing and targeting, \cite{Fras20}).

The first crucial step in this process is to establish precise objectives for the product launch. The aggregation of 
timelines and milestones can be particularly beneficial. These milestones effectively highlight the dynamic and and 
evolving nature of the product.

Some mistakenly believe that simply making their product or service available is enough and that customers will 
automatically find and buy from them without any personal interaction. This has misled many founders, especially those 
who have heard stories about successful companies like Dropbox or Twilio that seem to have no sales force. 

The launch is just the beginning, not the end. And sales skills are not innate; they can be learned like any other skill 
\cite{Dixo11}. Sales is simply another challenge to overcome, much like the technical hurdles we've faced before. Just 
as we've tackled complex technical problems through learning and problem solving, we can approach sales with the same 
and willingness to learn. Maintain audience engagement by implementing post-launch strategies, such as frequent updates, 
responsive customer support, and soliciting reviews and feedback. Marketing is an ongoing process, and post-launch 
activities are equally important. With the right strategy, we can pave the way for our product's success in the marketplace.
